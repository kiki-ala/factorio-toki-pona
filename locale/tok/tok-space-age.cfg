Building a space platform capable of surviving this far beyond the relative safety of the crash landing site proves your capability to travel anywhere else in the great depths of interstellar space beyond. For a space platform to survive this trip, it would need to be particularly self-sufficient and have the tools needed to turn the large, dangerous asteroids along the way into usable resources.
shattered-planet=A mysterious remnant of a former world far in the depths of interstellar space. Its remnants, floating in the space it once occupied, hold the resources to unlock powerful technologies. However, accessing them is not without risk...

fulgora-briefing=[planet=fulgora] is a dry barren planet with no signs of life and dangerous lightning activity in the frequent night cycles.\n[entity=solar-panel] is much less effective however lightning can be collected by [entity=lightning-rod] and stored in [entity=accumulator].\nThere are no natural resources found anywhere on the planet. The only things available are leftovers in the form of [entity=scrap].\nWhat might have been oceans is now full of [fluid=heavy-oil] that can be extracted by [entity=offshore-pump].\n[tile=oil-ocean-shallow] isn't landfillable until much later but it can be crossed by elevated rails. Building [entity=rail-support] on deep parts of the ocean will require additional research.
lightning-mechanics=[entity=lightning-rod] protects a small area from lightning strikes and converts the energy into the electric network.\nLightning generates a large amount of energy for a short period. Having more [entity=accumulator] will allow better usage of every lightning strike.\nIt can be later replaced by a more efficient [entity=lightning-collector].
gleba-briefing=[planet=gleba] is a humid swampy planet with rich exotic vegetation that can be cultivated using [entity=agricultural-tower] and processed in the [entity=biochamber].\nYou can't find [entity=iron-ore], [entity=copper-ore], [entity=crude-oil], [entity=coal], and [entity=uranium-ore] there but plants provide alternative ways of producing needed items.\nMost of the items from agriculture come with the added challenge of spoiling over time. Even [item=agricultural-science-pack] has limited lifespan and can't be stockpiled.\nLarge 5-legged creatures are native species of this planet. [entity=solar-panel] is weaker but still usable.
agriculture=[entity=agricultural-tower] allows planting seeds into seedable soil. Planted seeds grow into trees that can be harvested.\n[entity=yumako-tree] can grow on [tile=natural-yumako-soil]. It produces [item=yumako] which contains [item=yumako-seed] to replant the tree.\nThe plantation can be extended by landfilling nearby [tile=wetland-yumako] by [item=artificial-yumako-soil]. These areas are yellow on the map.\n[entity=jellystem] can grow on [tile=natural-jellynut-soil]. It produces [item=jellynut] which contains [item=jellynut-seed] to replant the tree.\nThe plantation can be extended by landfilling nearby [tile=wetland-jellynut] by [item=artificial-jellynut-soil]. These areas are magenta on the map.
vulcanus-briefing=[planet=vulcanus] is a hot planet without [fluid=water], you can't find [entity=crude-oil] or [entity=uranium-ore] there but it contains several new [tooltip=resources,tips-and-tricks-item-description.vulcanus-resources].\n[fluid=lava] is an infinite resource of minerals as a substitute for patches of [item=stone], [item=iron-ore], and [item=copper-ore]. Those can be found in raw form only in [entity=big-rock].\n[entity=solar-panel] is much more effective. The environment is inhospitable with mountainous volcanoes, rivers of lava, plains of ash, and sulfuric acid geysers.\n[tile=lava] isn't landfillable until much later but it can be crossed by elevated rails.
vulcanus-resources=Vulcanus resources:\n[entity=sulfuric-acid-geyser] Sulfuric acid geyser \n[entity=calcite] Calcite \n[entity=tungsten-ore] Tungsten ore
lava-processing=[fluid=lava] can be pumped by [entity=offshore-pump] and processed in [entity=foundry] into [item=stone], [fluid=molten-iron] and [fluid=molten-copper].\nIt is possible to remove waste items by moving them directly into [tile=lava].
aquilo-briefing=[planet=aquilo] is a freezing wasteland with ammoniacal oceans. It is the most distant planet where the usage of [entity=solar-panel] is practically impossible.\n[entity=logistic-robot] and [entity=construction-robot] are much weaker here.\nThe only familiar resource here is [entity=crude-oil] so the base will be dependent on planetary logistics. The player could end up stranded without enough support from other planets!\nThe surface is quite small and needs to be expanded. Oceans can be landfilled by [item=ice-platform] to be walkable. [item=concrete] is used as a foundation for buildings and protects the ice from melting.\nEntities need to be heated to operate using [entity=heating-tower] and [entity=heat-pipe].
heating-mechanics=[entity=heating-tower] can generate heat from fuel and does not stop burning when at maximum temperature.\nIt uses [entity=heat-pipe] to transfer heat into other entities.\nEvery entity needs to be touching a heat source in order to not freeze.\nThe exception is electric poles, [entity=solar-panel] and [entity=accumulator].
space-platform=Space platform is built remotely, with construction materials delivered by rockets. It can be used to transport players and cargo between planets.\n\n- [item=space-platform-starter-pack] is used to initialize platform, which is then expanded using [item=space-platform-foundation].\n- [entity=asteroid-collector] catches asteroids from space for materials.\n- [entity=crusher] is used to crush asteroids for resources.
orbital-logistics=[entity=space-platform-hub] can request items from the logistic network to be delivered by rockets. It is possible to auto-request missing construction materials.\n[entity=rocket-silo] can be set to automatically fulfill requests from space platforms.\n[entity=cargo-landing-pad] can request items from a space platform orbiting its planet, unless it is already requesting the item on this planet.\n__CONTROL__stack-transfer__ in the space platform hub GUI transfers a single stack manually to planet. Items will appear in [entity=cargo-pod-container] on starting coordinates.
removing-trash-in-space=[entity=inserter] can be used to remove waste items by moving them into the void of space.
asteroid-defense=[entity=gun-turret] can be used to break larger asteroids into asteroid chunks. These can be picked by [entity=asteroid-collector] and processed on the platform for resources. Larger asteroids damage the platform on impact.
space-science=In Space Age, [item=space-science-pack] can only be produced on a space platform using processed asteroid chunks.
spoilables=An item with [img=utility/tooltip_category_spoilable] spoilable property has a limited lifespan. When the time expires, the item spoils into a different one, like [item=spoilage].\nAn item with higher quality stays fresh for a longer time.
spoilables-result=Spoil progress of an ingredient affects spoil progress of the product.
spoilables-research=[item=agricultural-science-pack] gives less value the more it is spoiled.

fusion-generator=Consumes plasma from the [entity=fusion-reactor] to create electric energy. Power production is nominal, but less plasma is consumed if the temperature is higher. It outputs heated coolant equal to the amount of plasma consumed that can be cooled in an [entity=cryogenic-plant]. Fusion generators can be linked and transfer plasma to each other.
fusion-reactor=Uses fluoroketone coolant with fusion power cells to make super-heated plasma. It can only be output directly to an [entity=fusion-generator]. The neighbor bonus with other fusion reactors greatly increases the plasma temperature without increasing the amount of coolant used.
