[tips-and-tricks-item-description]
quality=Quality improves certain aspects of entities, items and equipment.\nEach entity has higher health with higher quality.\nEach entity type (apart from a few [tooltip=exceptions,tips-and-tricks-item-description.quality-bonus-exceptions]) gets its own unique bonus, like the reach of electric poles in this example.\nItems that can be used as buildable tiles can benefit from quality only as a part of other recipes. They revert to normal quality upon being placed as tiles.
quality-bonus-exceptions=Quality bonus exceptions:\n[entity=transport-belt] Transport belt \n[entity=pipe] Pipe \n[entity=straight-rail] Rail
quality-factoriopedia=Properties of entities, items and equipment are marked by the [img=quality_info] icon in the tooltip. \nWhen the related object is opened in Factoriopedia (__CONTROL__open-factoriopedia__), the icon can be hovered to show the specific values.
quality-modules=[tooltip=Quality Modules,tips-and-tricks-item-description.quality-module-list] increase the chance of producing higher quality items in [tooltip=Production entities,tips-and-tricks-item-description.production-entity-list].

quality-probabilities=The chance of producing an item with higher quality is 1% with one [item=quality-module,quality=normal] and can go up to 24.8% with four [item=quality-module-3,quality=legendary].\nThere is also a small chance of skipping steps and getting higher quality directly as shown in the table.
